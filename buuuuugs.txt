BUGS:
- When deleting a not gate, the gate its going into does not reset its node. | FIXED
- Sometimes the truth table just fails, dno why???? | Cant replicate, might be implementation is very inefficient so cant handle many variables
- Draggin the gates to the border has all sorts of issues. | Seems ok now
- make a full adder, bottom outputs expression is wrong??? | cant replicate

TODO:
- add disconnect method to gate canvas class. | DONE
- save load maybe. | no chance mate.
- add clock. | kinda, need to make clocks sync.
