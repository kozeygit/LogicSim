add gates connected to end of nodes to array,
run through array and add gates to queue.
run through the queue and execute each node to work out output

- Make a queue class
- add function to gate class to add node its output is connected to to array within object
-


thing to look up more about:
- javascript
- css
- html
- api
- linking pythonbackend to frontend website
- webGl (animation and stuff)
- js events
- maybe some sort of database
